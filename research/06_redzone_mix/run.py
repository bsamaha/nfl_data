Fact 6 â€” How has red-zone play mix and TD distribution changed?

Approach:
- Use `pbp` Silver (REG) and filter to red zone (yardline_100 <= 20).
- Compute per-season share of pass vs rush plays in red zone and share of pass TD vs rush TD.
- Output: CSV and HTML line chart (two panels) of red-zone pass share and TD pass share.
