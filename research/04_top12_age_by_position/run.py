Fact 4 â€” What are the age ranges for the top-12 fantasy scorers at each position by season?

Approach:
- Use `weekly` Silver to compute season-long DK points per player and position.
- Rank by DK points within each season and position, take top 12.
- Join to `rosters_seasonal` (seasonal roster) to get age if available; otherwise estimate from `birth_date` in players if present.
- Output: CSV and HTML boxplot of age distribution by position.

Notes:
- Age calculation: prefer `rosters_seasonal.age` if present; else players birth_date converted to years at mid-season (Nov 1).
