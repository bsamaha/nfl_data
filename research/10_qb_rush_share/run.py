Fact 10 â€” How has QB rushing contribution changed?

Approach:
- Use `weekly` Silver to compute per-season QB rushing share of team rushing yards and TDs.
- Aggregate by season: sum QB rushing yards / total rushing yards; sum QB rush TD / total rush TD.
- Output: CSV and HTML line chart with two series (yards share, TD share).
