Fact 5 â€” How have pass rates changed over time? (overall and neutral situations)

Approach:
- Use `pbp` Silver (REG) to compute per-season pass rate:
  pass_attempt=1 over offensive plays (pass_attempt OR rush_attempt OR sack).
- Neutral situation: score differential between -7 and +7, and between 2:00 and 12:00 of quarters 1-3.
- Output: CSV and HTML line chart for overall vs neutral pass rate by season.
