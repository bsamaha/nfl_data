Fact 3 â€” Are teams running more plays per game today than they used to?

Approach:
- Use `pbp` Silver (REG) to count offensive plays per game.
- Define offensive plays as rush_attempt=1 OR pass_attempt=1 OR sack=1.
- Aggregate to per-season average plays per game and per-team plays per game.
- Output: CSV and HTML line chart of avg plays per game by season.
