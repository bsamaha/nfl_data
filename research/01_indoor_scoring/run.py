Fact 1 â€” Do games in indoor stadiums score more points?

Approach:
- Use `pbp` (play-by-play) Silver to derive final game scores per `game_id`.
- Classify games by roof type (indoor/retractable/outdoor/unknown) from `pbp.roof`.
- Compute average total points per game by roof group, REG season only.
- Output: CSV and an HTML bar chart.
